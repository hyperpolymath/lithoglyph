= Form.ControlPlane (Elixir/OTP)
:toc:

Optional session management and cluster coordination layer.

== Purpose

* Session supervision
* Cluster edge coordination
* Out-of-process core engine (via ports)

== Rules

* Prefer out-of-process core engine over in-VM native calls
* Control plane MUST NOT redefine truth semantics
* Communicates with core via Form.Bridge

== Status

Deferred until core is stable. See Q-CTRL-PLANE-001 in link:../formdb.scm[formdb.scm].
