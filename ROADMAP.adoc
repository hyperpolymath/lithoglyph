POST /v1/query          # Execute FQL query
POST /v1/collections    # Create collection
GET  /v1/collections    # List collections
GET  /v1/journal        # Query journal entries
GET  /v1/health         # Health check
GET  /v1/metrics        # Prometheus metrics

  ~where=Field("status", Eq, "published"),
  ~provenance={actor: "editor@news.org", rationale: "Daily review"},
)
----

* [ ] PSR-18 HTTP client compatibility
* [ ] Composer package
* [ ] FQL query builder (fluent interface)

<?php
// Example usage
$result = $formdb->query()
    ->collection('articles')

    ->withProvenance('editor@news.org', 'Daily review')
    ->execute();

=== Acceptance Criteria

* Plugin installable from WordPress admin
* Posts stored in FormDB with full provenance
* Revision history shows narrative explanations
* Rollback works without data loss

* Cluster coordination
* Production supervision

=== Distribution

* Multi-node replication
* Consensus protocol selection
* Network protocol design

=== Ecosystem

* Additional language bindings (Rust, Python via HTTP)
* IDE integration (VS Code, JetBrains)
* Visualization tools
* FormDB Studio (zero-friction GUI)
* FormDB Debugger (proof-carrying debugger)
* Other CMS integrations (Drupal, Ghost, Strapi)

== Non-Goals (Explicitly Deferred)

* SQL compatibility layer
* OLAP optimizations
* Full-text search (use integration patterns instead)
* Time-series optimizations
* Real-time subscriptions (use CDC/webhooks instead)

These may be addressed post-PoC based on community needs.
