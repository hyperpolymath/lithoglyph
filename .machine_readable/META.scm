    (why-narrative-first
      "Traditional databases treat humans as second-class citizens.
       Error messages like 'UNIQUE constraint failed' explain nothing.
       FormDB believes every database artefact should tell a story:
       who changed what, why, and what it means.")

    (why-reversibility
      "DELETE in SQL is permanent. DROP TABLE is terrifying.
       FormDB journals everything with inverses. Any operation
       can be undone. Time-travel is a feature, not a hack.")

    (why-provenance
      "In journalism, governance, and archives, 'who said this and why'
       matters as much as the data itself. Provenance is not metadata -
       it's the soul of the record.")

    (why-multi-model
      "Real data is messy. Some is tabular, some is documents,
       some is graphs. FormDB doesn't force you to pick one model.
       Documents, edges, and schemas coexist naturally.")

    (why-constraints-as-ethics
      "A UNIQUE constraint isn't just a rule - it's a promise.
       A CHECK constraint encodes business ethics. FormDB makes
       constraints visible, explainable, and narratively meaningful.")

    (why-self-normalizing
      "Schema design is hard. Most developers get it wrong.
       FormDB can discover functional dependencies automatically
       and propose normalization with proofs of correctness.
       The database teaches you about your own data.")))
